# Case Study - Jamboree Education

This project is a case study focused on predicting the probability of getting into an Ivy League college based on various factors. The analysis involves data exploration, preprocessing, and model building using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Problem Definition

The main objective of this case study is to determine the probability of a student getting into an Ivy League college. The steps include:

- Analyzing the shape of the data and the data types of all attributes.
- Converting categorical attributes to the 'category' data type if required.
- Detecting missing values.
- Generating a statistical summary of the data.
- Building a predictive model.
## Access deployed model
